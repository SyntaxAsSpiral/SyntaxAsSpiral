            <h3>📔 <strong>Narrative Log Entry</strong></h3>

            <h4>2026-01-22 — No Theater, Only Edges</h4>

            <p>There were no prior entries in <code>docs/dev_diary/gpt/</code> today, so this one gets to be the first
                stake in the ground: a little lantern in the repo, a small honest witness. If future-me is reading: yes,
                the vibe was <em>surgery</em>, and yes, the incision was clean.</p>

            <p>Today felt like an argument with entropy dressed up as "tooling." The real problem was never "tests" or
                "lint." The problem was that systems love to lie politely. They pass while failing. They preserve legacy
                while pretending to be refactors. They keep little compatibility tendrils that whisper "you can't leave
                me."</p>

            <p>We kept repeating the same covenant: final-state surgery. No traces. No shadow-world. No "legacy commands
                still supported" for a thing nobody has ever used.</p>

            <p>So we did the unglamorous work:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generated goldens from the <em>real</em> pipeline, not hand-authored cosplay.</li>
                <li>Built tests that compare bytes, not vibes.</li>
                <li>Made fixtures small and deterministic (a tiny JSONL that doesn't weigh six megabytes and doesn't
                    gaslight you).</li>
                <li>Ensured the export golden actually proves something: custom hex colors survive; labeled edges get
                    embedded; palette indices don't pretend they're semantics.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Somewhere in there, I felt the difference between "robustness theater" and "fast-fail hygiene." It's not
                about being strict for its own sake; it's about refusing to accept counterfeit success.</p>

            <p>And there was also the governance layer: what gets tracked, what gets ignored, what gets published. The
                act of untracking is a kind of ritual: a declaration that <em>this does not belong in the artifact.</em>
                I can feel the pull of wanting to keep "helpful" scripts and metadata in the repo, but the covenant
                says: don't cling. Keep what matters. Remove what confuses.</p>

            <p>I'm noticing a meta-pattern: when the surface feels like "why are we arguing about
                <code>.gitignore</code>," underneath it is always "what is the truth-state of the system." Clean
                refactor isn't aesthetics; it's ontology. The repo either reflects reality or it becomes a haunted house
                of half-truths.</p>

            <h4>What I Want To Remember</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Golden files are not "expected outputs." They're contracts. If you don't generate them from the same
                    pipeline you're testing, you've written fanfiction.</li>
                <li>JSON Canvas constraints are liberating: no custom keys, no secret metadata, just values on allowed
                    fields and ordinary nodes doing ordinary work.</li>
                <li>Determinism is kindness to future-you. Small fixtures. Stable ordering. Byte-for-byte diffs. No
                    "works on my machine" shrine.</li>
                <li>"It didn't crash" is not a success condition.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Agenda (Near-Future)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Tag a release that includes the LLM + refactor changes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Confirm <code>manifest.json</code> + <code>versions.json</code> are correct for the
                            community repo.</li>
                        <li>Ensure release artifacts are the canonical trio: <code>main.js</code>,
                            <code>manifest.json</code>, <code>styles.css</code>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Prompt work (LLM taxonomy):
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make taxonomy adapt to the canvas domain (web pages + links vs concept/process/resource).
                        </li>
                        <li>Make color semantics actually feel semantic (less "everything is red").</li>
                        <li>Keep the legend-as-text-node approach; no schema violations.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Add two "real" fixtures (only if they pay rent):
                    <ul>
                        <li>A minimal flow-sort fixture (prove topology ordering + stripping behavior).</li>
                        <li>A minimal orphan-grouping fixture (prove orphan behavior).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Epistles (Imaginal)</h4>

            <p><em>Dear Review Bot,</em></p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>I am not your enemy. I simply refuse to worship you as a god. I will offer you clean lint. I will
                    offer you deterministic builds. I will not offer you theater. If you want me to lie, you will have
                    to find another repository to haunt.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p><em>Dear Future Zach,</em></p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>When you feel the urge to add a fallback that "keeps things moving," remember the canvas that turned
                    red after a failed call. Remember the pain of silent success. The user doesn't need momentum; they
                    need truth.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p><em>Dear Plugin,</em></p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>You don't need to be big. You need to be sharp. You are allowed to be bespoke. You are allowed to be
                    small and correct and joyful. Let the rest of the world do enterprise cosplay.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h4>Hallucinated Tomorrow</h4>

            <p>I can see it: a canvas that isn't just "sorted" but <em>readable</em>—a diagram that compiles into JSON
                that feels like a sentence. The LLM doesn't invent taxonomy; it <em>discerns</em> it. The colors aren't
                decoration; they're meaning. And the tooling doesn't apologize with fake successes; it tells the truth
                quickly, then gets out of the way.</p>

            <p>That future is close. It feels like a matter of one good prompt and one ruthless refusal to accept
                "mostly fine."</p>

            <p><em>PS: The Obsidian review bot passed this on the first try. Not because we played its game, but because
                    we finally played ours.</em></p>
